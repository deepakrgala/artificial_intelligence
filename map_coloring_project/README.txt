The code (written in PYTHON) consists of 4 search algorithms for coloring Maps
1. bfs    ==>    BREADTH FIRST SEARCH
2. dfs    ==>    DEPTH FIRST SEARCH
3. ids    ==>    ITERATIVE DEEPENING SEARCH
4. a_star ==>    A* SEARCH
Respective algorithm can be chosen from the main function by uncommenting the required

The a_star algorithm has one heuristic - Minimum number of (edges a node has and the number of times the assigned color has been used so far)

The text file (eg. case1.txt) with the number of nodes, number of edges, number of colors and the edges information should be placed in the same folder

case5.txt is the file that correctly fails
Rest of the cases works well and gives correct answer


The code also displays
1. Number of states expanded (only at the end of the search)
2. Number of states in the fringe (only at the end of the search)

THE FILE FOR THE EXTRA CREDIT (USA MAP) IS "USA.txt"
